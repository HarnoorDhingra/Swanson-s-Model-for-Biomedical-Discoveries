171 
Congenital malformations 
 Congenital malformations, immunodeficiency, radiation hypersensitivity, and cancer predisposition were comprehensible in case of dysfunctioning of DNA repair mechanisms. 

172 
congenital pigmentary disorders 
 With these in mind, this study reappraises the patterns of congenital pigmentary disorders in humans and identifies three recurrent patterns consistent across genetically different diseases. 

173 
contact leukoderma 
 The appearance of contact leukoderma may be indistinguishable from idiopathic vitiligo. 

174 
contralateral tumors 
 We use two mouse models of pancreatic cancer to show that a single dose of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) synergizes with intratumoral injection of agonistic anti-CD40, resulting in regression of non-treated contralateral tumors and formation of long-term immunologic memory.

 Also highlighted, the first clinical trial of siRNA for cutaneous diseases, aimed at Pathyounychia Congenita. 

189 
cutaneous disorders 
 In addition, as this increased skin cancer risk is likely due to impaired UVA and UVB defence mechanisms, consideration of genetic predisposition may also be appropriate for patients undergoing psoralen + UVA (PUVA) or UVB treatments for various cutaneous disorders, such as psoriasis, eczema, and vitiligo.

 Original aspects of cutaneous infections will be discussed along with new data on STDs (meningococcemia in MSMs, HPV, Herpes, congenital syphilis).

200 
cutaneous neoplasms 
 An increased frequency of cutaneous neoplasms in depigmented areas is a potential hazard, as in these sites the photoprotective effect of melanin is lacking.  

201 
cutaneous phototoxicity 
 The observed photoprotective activities of oral or topical PL reveal a new avenue in examining the potentially useful field of systemic photoprotection and suggests that PL can be used as adjunct treatment and can make photochemotherapy and phototherapy possibly safe and effective when the control of cutaneous phototoxicity to PUVA or UVB is a limiting factor in such phototherapies.  

202 
cutaneous sarcoidosis 
 Recent case reports of Sweet syndrome and cutaneous sarcoidosis have also recently been described after treatment with ipilimumab. 

203 
Cutaneous toxicities 
 Cutaneous toxicities appear to be one of the most prevalent irAEs, both with anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 agents or with the newly developed anti-PD-L1 agents, which corresponds to a class effect. 

204 
cytopenia 
 Described irAEs consisted of skin lesions (rash, pruritus, and vitiligo), colitis, and less frequently hepatitis, hypophysitis, thyroiditis, and some rare events such as sarcoidosis, uveitis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, immune-mediated cytopenia and polymyalgia rheumatic/Horton.

 Chemotherapeutic agents such as mitomycin C or nitrogen mustards induce DNA inter-strand cross-links (ICL) and are highly toxic, thus constituting an useful tool to treat some human degenerative diseases, such as cancer.

 In vivo plasmid electroporation induces tumor antigen-specific CD8+ T-cell responses and delays tumor growth in a syngeneic mouse melanoma model. 

214 
demyelination 
 Although vitiligo or demyelination could be induced by additional stimuli (i.e., surgery or inflammation) in DCT-vaccinated mice, it did not extend beyond the inflammatory area, suggesting that there is self-regulatory negative feedback in normal tissues.

 BACKGROUND: Vitiligo is a common depigmented skin disorder that is caused by selective destruction of melanocytes. 

221

222 
depigmented skin 
 PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that regardless of human skin phototype, areas of depigmented skin, as seen in vitiligo, are optically indistinguishable among skin phototypes. 

223 
depigmenting disease 
 These observations point to a critical suppressor of innate immunity, the consequences of innate immune dysregulation on pigmentation, both of which may have implications in the autoimmune, depigmenting disease, vitiligo. 

224 
depressive symptoms 
 Patients affected by vitiligo usually show a poorer quality of life and are more likely to suffer from depressive symptoms, particularly evident in dark-skinned individuals. 

225 
dermal depigmentation 
 Our findings provide strong evidence for the effective induction of specific T-cell responses to Melan A/MART-1 by i.d. immunization with peptide alone, which accounts for dermal depigmentation, specific cytotoxicity against Melan A/MART-1-expressing melanoma cells and clinical tumor regression.

766 
systemic autoimmunity 
 The administration of a TriVax formulation containing a CD8 T-cell epitope derived from a melanosomal antigen (Trp2(180-188)) elicited antigen-specific CD8 T cells that induced systemic autoimmunity (vitiligo). 

767 
systemic diseases 
 Furthermore, multiple human systemic diseases (autoimmune, blood and digestive diseases) have skin manifestation, thus "condition of the skin" often reflects the condition and pathological changes within the internal organs. 

768 
systemic disorders 
 In addition, vitiligo has been associated with other rare systemic disorders due to the presence of melanocytes in other body districts, such as in eyes, auditory, nervous, and cardiac tissues, where melanocytes are thought to have roles different from that played in the skin. 

769 
T2D 
 We confirmed the validity of our findings by analyzing independent sets of most significant disease-linked SNPs and demonstrating statistically significant KPNA1-gene expression phenotypes associated with human genotypes of CD, BD, T2D and RA populations.

779 
thyroid carcinoma 
 Then, clinical observation enabled to discover that 3 of 15,126 patients had undergone exeresis for a thyroid carcinoma and in the 890 vitiligo patients, who had undergone particular investigations, we found a thyroid carcinoma in 3 subjects. 

780 
thyroid damage 
 It is hypothesized that an abnormality in the control of autoimmune responses is present in this disease and leads to production of high levels of autoantibodies that may stimulate the thyroid or eventually cause thyroid damage and cell death. 

781

792 
tumor cell dissemination 
 The treatment also delayed tumor cell dissemination and induced vitiligo in a significant proportion of Ret mice. 

793

810 
virus infections 
 As can be inferred from all these functions, TXNDC5 plays an important role in cell physiology; therefore, dysregulation of its expression is associated with oxidative stress, cell ageing and a large range of pathologies such as arthritis, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases, vitiligo and virus infections.
